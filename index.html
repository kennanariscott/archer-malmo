		<h3>My Experience at Archer Malmo</h3>
		<p>Our trip to Archer Malmo was an educational experience. I definitely learned a lot about the Web Design field. Even if the lecture was not very entertaining, I could still learn a lot of the process. It was a pleasure to be able to visit and see the inside of the Archer Malmo facility. The whole experience really allowed me to see the inside of the field and showed me that it's something I would want to do. </p>

			<h3>The Trip There</h3>
			<p>The trip there was pretty normal, just your casual Memphis roads. It didn't take long for us to get there at all. I sat alone and talked to a few of my friends that also sat close to the back of the bus. A few people played Uno, and it smelled like a locker room. Nothing else was too memorable though.</p>

				<h3>Ariving at Archer Malmo</h3>
				<p>Once we arrived at Archer Malmo, we had to walk a short distance to get to the entrance. On the way there, I spotted some graffiti that could ironically describe the majority of the trip. The entrance to the Archer Malmo building itself looked pretty nice. The Holiday decorations were a nice touch.</p>

				<h3>The Inside of the Office</h3>
				<p>Once we were inside the building, we had to take an elevator up to the proper floor. Once we were up, we came out onto the main room of the office. It was pretty nice for a workspace. There was a pin-pong table and a wallmount for bikes which were both nice commdities. The desk in the center of the room was well kempt and I learned a lot of valuable information from the presentation.</p>

				<h3>The Rest of the Building</h3>
				<p>Above the office was an area that looked like it belonged on the first floor of the building. The man giving the presentation and helping us along, a Mr. Gabe, said that was generally whhere clients would come and talk to representatives of the company. We even got to go down to the basement where they have a broadcasting toom with a lot of interesting things</p>

				<h3>Cookout</h3>
				<p>Before we headed home, we stopped at Cookout for lunch. It was a great time filled with laughs. The highlight of the day had to be when I downed a cheesecake in less than ten seconds (The video of which I can't share on this website). If I'm being honest, that was probably my greatest accomplishment of all time. Even if I can't share it here, the memory of it will live forever in my mind. Easy feast.
